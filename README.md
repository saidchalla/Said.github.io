The repository I created is named "said.github.io" where "said" matches my GitHub username. This repository serves as my personal GitHub Pages repository. It acts as a hosting space for my website files, allowing me to publish a website using GitHub Pages. The repository's purpose is to showcase my projects, portfolio, or any other content I wish to share with the world.
To clone the repository onto my local machine, I opened GitHub Desktop, logged in, selected "Clone a repository," chose "said.github.io" from my repositories list, specified the local location, and clicked "Clone repository."
